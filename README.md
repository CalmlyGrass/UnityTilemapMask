# UnityTilemapMask
The mask component. Works the same as SpriteMask, but used for tilemaps. 

### How to use

Apply the component to the object that the Tilemap is on and select the mask prefab.

Also don't forget to set the Mask Interaction to "Visible Inside Mask" inside all SpriteRenderers of your sprites, which should only appear inside the mask.
