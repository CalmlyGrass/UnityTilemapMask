# UnityTilemapMask
The mask component. Works the same as SpriteMask, but used for tilemaps. 

### How to use

Apply the component to the object that the Tilemap is on and select the mask prefab.
Also don't forget to set Mask Interaction to Visible Inside Mask inside of all SpriteRenderers of your sprites that need to be showed only inside mask.
